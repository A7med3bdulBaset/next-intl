# TypeScript integration

`next-intl` integrates with TypeScript out-of-the box without additional setup. To take full advantage of your type system, you can optionally provide the shape of your messages to `next-intl` in order to get type safety for your message keys.

To do this, add a global type definition file in your project root (e.g. `global.d.ts`) in your project root:

```jsx
type Messages = typeof import('./path/to/example/messages.json');
declare interface GlobalMessages extends Messages {}
```

You can freely define the interface, but if you have your messages available locally it can be helpful to automatically create the interface based on a local example.

Note that you have to name the interface `IntlMessages` so `next-intl` is able to detect it correctly. This integration is only available from TypeScript version 4 upwards.
