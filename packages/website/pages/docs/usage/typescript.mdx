# TypeScript integration

`next-intl` integrates with TypeScript out-of-the box without additional setup. To take full advantage of your type system, you can optionally provide the shape of your messages to `next-intl` in order to get type safety for your namespaces and message keys.

To do this, add a global type definition file in your project root (e.g. `global.d.ts`):

```jsx
type Messages = typeof import('./path/to/sample/messages.json');
declare interface StrictIntlMessages extends Messages {}
```

You can freely define the interface, but if you have your messages available locally, it can be helpful to automatically create the interface based on a local messages sample.

Note that you have to name the interface `StrictIntlMessages` so `next-intl` is able to detect it correctly. This integration is only available from TypeScript version 4 upwards.

After this is set up, TypeScript will provide auto-completion and type safety for both the namespaces you pass to `useTranslations` as well as the message key that is passed to the translation function `t`:

```js
// messages.json

{
  "About": {
    "title": "Hello"
  }
}
```

```tsx
// About.tsx

function About() {
  // Valid namespace ✅
  const t = useTranslations('About');

  // Valid message key ✅
  return <p>{t('title')}</p>;
}
```
